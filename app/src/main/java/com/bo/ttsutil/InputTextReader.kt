/**
 * This abstract TextWatcher class is used to read input text changes with
 * text-to-speech.
 *
 * Implementations should define `readChangedText(CharSequence)' method.
 *
 * Text is read according to the following rules:
 *  1. If only one character was inserted and it was not a delimiter (see below),
 *     read it as if a word was being spelt out character-by-character.
 *  2. If only one character was inserted and it was a delimiter, read the word
 *     before it, if there is one, which we assume has just been spelt out.
 *  3. If two delimiters appear after a word, only read the word for the first one
 *     inserted.
 *  4. If the character sequence has entirely changed, read from the start to the
 *     end normally.
 *
 * Spaces, full stops, ellipses, commas, colons, semicolons, exclamation marks,
 * question marks and quotation marks are the "delimiters" mentioned in the first
 * three rules.  The Unicode "Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms" of these symbols are
 * also treated as delimiters.
